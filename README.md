# Coding Style
<br>
This project utilized eslint-config-airbnb for the code styling.<br>
This was accomplished by installing the plugin for Atom.<br>
You can find documentation about eslint here:<br> [eslint-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) <br>
and for installing on Atom you can find the documentation here.<br>
[eslint for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/eslint).


# Unit Testing
In order for this to work you MUST HAVE mocha and chai installed using npm globally.<br>
Once you have done this you can run a test for each route.<br>

For the /go/:shortenedURL test the short url of CHfApl<br>
for this to be accomplished CHfApl needs to be in your database.<br>

Ready. Set. GO.<br>
  1. .get('/go/CHfApl') // This has to be in the database

If you're lucky the test should come back passed<br>
If not, try and try again...
